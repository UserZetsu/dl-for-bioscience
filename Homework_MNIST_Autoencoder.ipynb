In this homework, we'll implement autoencoders in the context of MNIST.

Please make sure you're running Python 3 with PyTorch (and Torchvision) installed and ready to go, along with NumPy and Matplotlib. Although you might find that these models train a bit faster on GPU, this homework assignment should be doable on most modern laptops. If you're having trouble please let us know ASAP.\n",

        "  - Make a copy of this notebook in your Google Drive folder: \"File\" -> \"Save a copy in Drive...\"\n",
        "  - By default, Colab does not make GPUs available, but you can easily access them by selecting GPU in \"Runtime\" -> \"Change runtime type...\"\n",
